        complying with these data and privacy laws.</p>
    <p><strong>GDPR</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Individual Customers</strong>: If you are using our Services for your own personal purposes (as opposed
        to in connection with your employment through a subscription obtained through your employer) your data
        controller for the purpose of GDPR is ACG.</p>
    <p><strong>Corporate Customers</strong>: If you are using our Services in connection with your employment, your
        employer is your data controller for the purposes of the GDPR, and we are the data processor collecting and
        using that data only to provide the services to your employer. Your employer may have their own privacy notices
        that will apply to your use of our Services. Your employer will have access to your information we collect in

    <p>Under GDPR, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, your rights in your personal information include the
        following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The right to be informed</strong> about whether your personal information is being processed and to
            <strong>request access to and certain information about</strong> your information we process.</li>
        <li><strong>The right to request that we correct or update</strong> any information you believe is inaccurate
            and to request that we complete any information you believe is incomplete.</li>
        <li><strong>The</strong> <strong>right to request that we erase</strong> your personal information in certain
            situations, including:<ul>
                <li>where it is no longer necessary for us to hold your personal information for the purpose originally
                    collected or processed;</li>
                <li>where you have provided your personal information to us with your consent and you wish to withdraw
                    your consent, and there is no other legal ground under which we can process your personal data;</li>
                <li>where we are processing your personal information on the basis of legitimate interests and you
                    object to such processing and we cannot demonstrate an overriding legitimate ground for the
                    processing; or</li>
                <li>where you believe the personal information we hold about you is being unlawfully processed by us.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The right to request that we restrict processing</strong> of your personal information in certain
            situations, including:<ul>
                <li>where you believe the personal information we hold about you is inaccurate and while we verify
                    accuracy;</li>
                <li>where we want to erase your personal information due to unlawful processing but you want us to
                    continue to store it;</li>
                <li>where we no longer need your personal information for the purposes of our processing but you require
                    us to retain the data for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or</li>
                <li>where you have objected to us processing your personal information based on our legitimate interests
                    and we are considering your objection.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>The right to request that we transfer personal information</strong> collected to another
            organization or directly to you.</li>
        <li><strong>The</strong> <strong>right to object to/stop our processing</strong> of your personal information

    </ul>
    <p>Please note that these rights above are limited under GDPR, for example, where fulfilling your request would
        adversely affect other individuals, our trade secrets or intellectual property, where there are overriding
        public interest reasons, or where we are required by law to retain your personal information. In addition, if
        you consider that our processing of personal data relating to you infringes your rights under GDPR, you have the
        right to complain to your applicable data protection supervisory authority.</p>
