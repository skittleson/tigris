        </em>
        <br />

        <br />
        These are the terms of use for Tigris Mediterranean Grille (the “Terms”). These Terms are important and they affect your legal
        rights, so please read them carefully. Please note that Section 18 of these Terms contains a mandatory
        arbitration provision that requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis and limits the remedies
        available to you in the event of certain disputes.
        <br />

        <br />
        By accessing or using the websites, mobile applications or blogs (collectively, the “Sites”) provided by
        Tigris Mediterranean Grille or our subsidiaries or other affiliates (collectively, “Tigris Mediterranean Grille,” “we,” “us” or “our”)
        that link to these Terms, you agree to be bound by these Terms and all of the terms incorporated herein by
        reference. If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not access or use the Sites or order, receive or use the

        represent and warrant that you are authorized to accept these Terms on such entity’s behalf and that such entity
        agrees to be responsible to us if you or such entity violates these Terms.
        <br />

        <br />
        Tigris Mediterranean Grille reserves the right to change or modify these Terms at any time and in our sole discretion. If we
        make changes to these Terms, we will provide notice of such changes, such as by sending an email notification,
        providing notice through the Sites or updating the “Last Updated” date at the beginning of these Terms. By
        continuing to access or use the Sites or order, receive or use Products, you confirm your acceptance of the
        revised Terms and all of the terms incorporated therein by reference. We encourage you to review the Terms
        frequently to ensure that you understand the terms and conditions that apply when you access or use the Sites or
        order, receive or use the Products. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, you may not access or use the
        Sites or order, receive or use the Products.

        the specific terms of your free trial will be provided in the marketing materials describing the particular

        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 4.4. Payment and Billing Information</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        By providing a credit card or other payment method that we accept, you
        represent and warrant that you are authorized to use the designated payment method and that you authorize us (or
        our third party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the total amount of your subscription or
        other purchase (including any applicable taxes and other charges) (collectively, as applicable, an “Order”). If
        the payment method cannot be verified, is invalid or is otherwise not acceptable, your Order may be suspended or
        cancelled. You must resolve any problem we encounter in order to proceed with your Order. In the event you want
        to change or update payment information associated with your Tigris Mediterranean Grille account, you can do so at any time by
        logging into your account and editing your payment information.
        <br />

        <br />
        You acknowledge that the amount billed may vary due to promotional offers,
        changes to your Coffee Subscription or changes in applicable taxes or other charges, and you authorize us (or
        our third party payment processor) to charge your payment method for the corresponding amount.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 4.5. Pricing and Availability</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        All prices are shown in U.S. dollars and applicable taxes and other charges,
        if any, are additional. We reserve the right to adjust prices as we may determine in our sole discretion, at any
        time and without notice; provided, however, that if we change the amounts or other charges associated with your
        Coffee Subscription, we will provide advance notice of such changes in accordance with Section 3. We will not,
        however, be able to notify you of changes in any applicable taxes. The shipment of coffee to you after our
        delivery of such notice will confirm your acceptance of such changes, unless you cancel your subscription(s) in
        accordance with the cancellation policies set forth in Section 4.1.
        <br />

        <br />
        All of our Products are subject to availability, and we reserve the right to
        impose quantity limits on any Order, to reject all or part of an Order, to discontinue offering certain Products
        and to substitute Products (including, but not limited to, specific coffees) without prior notice. We strive to
        provide you with high-quality Products, and given the perishable nature of certain Products and market
        conditions beyond our control, we may be required to make substitutions from time to time. If you are not
        satisfied with a substitution, please contact us at help@tigrisgrille.com.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 4.6. Taxes</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        We will collect applicable sales tax on Products shipped to the states for
        which we determine we have a duty to collect sales tax. If an item is subject to sales tax, you agree that the
        amount of taxes shown at checkout may be adjusted. Several factors may cause this, such as variances between
        processor programs and changes in tax rates.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 4.7. Shipping and Handling</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        You agree to pay any shipping and handling charges shown at the time you make
        a purchase. We reserve the right to increase, decrease, add or eliminate shipping and handling charges from time
        to time, but we will provide notice of the charges applicable to you before you make your purchase. Generally,
        shipping is handled by a third party courier. When you purchase a Product from Tigris Mediterranean Grille, any shipping times
        shown on the Sites are estimates only. Actual delivery dates may vary. You agree that you will not obtain, or
        direct shipment of, a Product for export. All Products purchased from us are made pursuant to a shipment
        contract. This means that title to and the risk of loss of such Products passes to you upon our delivery of the
        Product to the third party courier.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 4.8. Deliveries</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        You are responsible for inspecting all Products you receive from us for any
        damage or other issues upon delivery. In addition, you are solely responsible for determining the freshness of
        the Products you receive.
        <br />
        If you are not at home when your delivery arrives, the courier will generally
        leave the package for you at your door. Any individual at the delivery address who accepts a delivery from us is
        presumed to be authorized to receive such delivery. In cases in which you have designated an alternative
        receiver, such person shall accept the delivery under all of the same terms and conditions that would apply had
        you accepted the delivery yourself.
        <br />

        <br />
        In the case of inclement weather or other events beyond our control that
        interfere with our ability to deliver your Order, we will attempt to deliver your Order as soon as reasonably
        possible. In some cases, delivery may occur prior to the scheduled delivery date. In the event that timely
        delivery of your coffee is not feasible, we will cancel your coffee delivery for the period so affected and
        issue you a credit or refund of the purchase price for that coffee delivery.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 4.9. No Resale</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        You are not permitted to resell or otherwise use the Products for commercial
        purposes.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 4.10. Returns and Refunds</strong>
        <br />

        Tigris Mediterranean Grille PARTIES FROM AND AGAINST, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE ANY SUCH Tigris Mediterranean Grille PARTY FOR, ALL CLAIMS YOU
        HAVE OR MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THESE TERMS. IF YOU ARE A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT, YOU
        HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHTS UNDER CALIFORNIA CIVIL CODE 1542, WHICH STATES “A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO
        CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE
        RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR.”</p>
    <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above
        limitation or exclusion may not apply to you. Some jurisdictions also limit disclaimers or limitations of
        liability for personal injury from consumer products, so this limitation may not apply to personal injury
        claims.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong>17. Modifications to the Sites and Products</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        We reserve the right in our sole discretion to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the
        Sites (or any features or parts thereof) or the provision of the Products at any time and without liability
        therefor.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong>18. Dispute Resolution; Arbitration</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT REQUIRES YOU TO
        ARBITRATE CERTAIN DISPUTES AND CLAIMS WITH Tigris Mediterranean Grille AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF FROM
        US.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 18.1. Binding Arbitration</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        Except for any disputes, claims, suits, actions, causes of action, demands or
        proceedings (collectively, “Disputes”) arising out of or related to a violation of Section 10 or Disputes in
        which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or other
        equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation,
        copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Tigris Mediterranean Grille agree (a) to waive
        your and Tigris Mediterranean Grille’s respective rights to have any and all Disputes arising from or related to these Terms,
        or the Sites, Content or Products, resolved in a court, and (b) to waive your and Tigris Mediterranean Grille’s respective
        rights to a jury trial. Instead, you and Tigris Mediterranean Grille agree to arbitrate Disputes through binding arbitration
        (which is the referral of a Dispute to one or more persons charged with reviewing the Dispute and making a final
        and binding determination to resolve it instead of having the Dispute decided by a judge or jury in court).
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 18.2. No Class Arbitrations, Class Actions or Representative
            Actions</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        You and Tigris Mediterranean Grille agree that any Dispute arising out of or related to these
        Terms or the Sites, Content or Products is personal to you and Tigris Mediterranean Grille and that such Dispute will be
        resolved solely through individual arbitration and will not be brought as a class arbitration, class action or
        any other type of representative proceeding. You and Tigris Mediterranean Grille agree that there will be no class arbitration
        or arbitration in which an individual attempts to resolve a Dispute as a representative of another individual or
        group of individuals. Further, you and Tigris Mediterranean Grille agree that a Dispute cannot be brought as a class or other
        type of representative action, whether within or outside of arbitration, or on behalf of any other individual or
        group of individuals.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 18.3. Federal Arbitration Act</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        You and Tigris Mediterranean Grille agree that these Terms affect interstate commerce and
        that the enforceability of this Section 18 shall be both substantively and procedurally governed by and
        construed and enforced in accordance with the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. (the “FAA”), to the
        maximum extent permitted by applicable law.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 18.4. Notice; Informal Dispute Resolution</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        You and Tigris Mediterranean Grille agree that each party will notify the other party in
        writing of any arbitrable or small claims Dispute within thirty (30) days of the date it arises, so that the
        parties can attempt in good faith to resolve the Dispute informally. Notice to Tigris Mediterranean Grille shall be sent by
        certified mail or courier to Tigris Mediterranean Grille, Inc., Attn: Legal Department, 929 SW University Blvd., Suite 2704,
        Topeka KS 66619. Your notice must include (a) your name, postal address, telephone number, the email address you
        use or used for your Tigris Mediterranean Grille account and, if different, an email address at which you can be contacted, (b)
        a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (c) the specific relief that you
        are seeking. Our notice to you will be sent electronically in accordance with Section 3 and will include (x) our
        name, postal address, telephone number and an email address at which we can be contacted with respect to the
        Dispute, (y) a description in reasonable detail of the nature or basis of the Dispute, and (z) the specific
        relief that we are seeking. If you and Tigris Mediterranean Grille cannot agree how to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30)
        days after the date notice is received by the applicable party, then either you or Tigris Mediterranean Grille may, as
        appropriate and in accordance with this Section 18, commence an arbitration proceeding or, to the extent
        specifically provided for in Section 18.1, file a claim in court.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 18.5. Process</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        Except for Disputes arising out of or related to a violation of Section 10 or
        Disputes in which either party seeks to bring an individual action in small claims court or seeks injunctive or
        other equitable relief for the alleged unlawful use of intellectual property, including, without limitation,
        copyrights, trademarks, trade names, logos, trade secrets or patents, you and Tigris Mediterranean Grille agree that any
        Dispute must be commenced or filed by you or Tigris Mediterranean Grille within one (1) year of the date the Dispute arose,
        otherwise the underlying claim is permanently barred (which means that you and Tigris Mediterranean Grille will no longer have
        the right to assert such claim regarding the Dispute). You and Tigris Mediterranean Grille agree that (a) any arbitration will
        occur in the State of Kansas, County of Shawnee, City of Topeka, (b) arbitration will be conducted
        confidentially by a single arbitrator in accordance with the rules of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
        Services (“JAMS”), which are hereby incorporated by reference, and (c) that the state or federal courts of the
        State of Kansas and the United States, respectively, sitting in the State of Kansas, County of Shawnee, City of
        Topeka, have exclusive jurisdiction over any appeals and the enforcement of an arbitration award. You may also
        litigate a Dispute in the small claims court located in the county of your billing address if the Dispute meets
        the requirements to be heard in small claims court.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 18.6. Authority of Arbitrator</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        As limited by the FAA, these Terms and the applicable JAMS rules, the
        arbitrator will have (a) the exclusive authority and jurisdiction to make all procedural and substantive
        decisions regarding a Dispute, including the determination of whether a Dispute is arbitrable, and (b) the
        authority to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court; provided, however, that the arbitrator
        does not have the authority to conduct a class arbitration or a representative action, which is prohibited by
        these Terms. The arbitrator may only conduct an individual arbitration and may not consolidate more than one
        individual’s claims, preside over any type of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding
        involving more than one individual.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 18.7. Rules of JAMS</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        The rules of JAMS and additional information about JAMS are available on the
        <a href="https://www.jamsadr.com/">JAMS website</a>.
        By agreeing to be bound by these Terms, you either (a) acknowledge and agree that you have read and understand
        the rules of JAMS, or (b) waive your opportunity to read the rules of JAMS and any claim that the rules of JAMS
        are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 18.8. Severability</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        If any term, clause or provision of this Section 18 is held invalid or
        unenforceable, it will be so held to the minimum extent required by law, and all other terms, clauses and
        provisions of this Section 18 will remain valid and enforceable. Further, the waivers set forth in Section 18.2
        are severable from the other provisions of these Terms and will remain valid and enforceable, except as
        prohibited by applicable law.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong> 18.9. Opt-Out Right</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        You have the right to opt out of binding arbitration within thirty (30) days
        of the date you first accepted the terms of this Section 18 by writing to: Tigris Mediterranean Grille. In order to be
        effective, the opt out notice
        must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to opt out of binding arbitration. By opting out of
        binding arbitration, you are agreeing to resolve Disputes in accordance with Section 19.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong>19. Governing Law and Venue</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        These Terms, your access to and use of the Sites and your order, receipt and use of the Products shall be
        governed by and construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of Kansas, without regard to
        conflict of law rules or principles (whether of the State of Kansas or any other jurisdiction) that would cause
        the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. Any Dispute between the parties that is not subject to
        arbitration or cannot be heard in small claims court, shall be resolved in the state or federal courts of the
        State of Kansas and the United States, respectively, sitting in the State of Kansas, County of Shawnee, City of
        Topeka.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong>20. Termination</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        Notwithstanding anything contained in these Terms, we reserve the right, without notice and in our sole
        discretion, to terminate your right to access or use the Sites and to order, receive and use the Products, at
        any time and for any or no reason, and you acknowledge and agree that we shall have no liability or obligation
        to you in such event and that you will not be entitled to a refund of any amounts that you have already paid to
        us, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>21. Severability</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        If any term, clause or provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, then that term, clause or
        provision will be severable from these Terms and will not affect the validity or enforceability of any remaining
        part of that term, clause or provision, or any other term, clause or provision of these Terms.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong>22. Survival</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        The following sections will survive the expiration or termination of these Terms and the termination of your
        Tigris Mediterranean Grille account: all defined terms and Sections 1, 3, 4, 5 (first paragraph only), 6, 7, 8 (second
        paragraph only), 9 through 23.
        <br />

        <br />
        <strong>23. Miscellaneous</strong>
        <br />

        <br />
        These Terms constitute the entire agreement between you and Tigris Mediterranean Grille relating to your access to and use of
        the Sites and your order, receipt and use of Products. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted
        hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you without the prior written consent of Tigris Mediterranean Grille. No
        waiver of any provision of these Terms will constitute a waiver of such provision in any prior, concurrent or
        subsequent circumstance, and Tigris Mediterranean Grille’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not
        constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Except as otherwise provided herein, these Terms are intended
        solely for the benefit of the parties and are not intended to confer third party beneficiary rights upon any
        other person or entity.
