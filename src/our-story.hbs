        <p class="lead">Welcome to Tigris Meditteranean Grille, where every dish
          is a voyage through the rich tapestry of time, history, and culture.
        </p>
        <p>Our story begins in 2000, in the heart of Baghdad, Iraq<code>&#8212;</code>a city
          where the Tigris River has flowed for millennia, nurturing
          civilizations and shaping cultures. It was here, along the banks of
          this ancient river, that we first opened our doors, inspired by the
          rich culinary traditions of Mesopotamia and a deep love for the flavors 
          of our homeland.</p>
        <p>
          Our vision was clear: to bring the authentic tastes of the Middle East to life, 
          crafting each dish in an ambiance that exudes warmth, hospitality, and the depth of our culture.
        </p>
        <p>  
          In 2003, as Baghdad entered a new chapter in its storied history, so
          did we. Amidst the challenges of a new era, we were honored to serve
          those who came from afar, including the US army and embassy. It was a 
          time marked by both turmoil and hope, and through it all, our kitchen 
          became a sanctuary<code>&#8212;</code>a place where the universal language 
          of food transcended borders and brought people together. </p>
        <p>But our journey was far from over. In 2005, Tigris Meditteranean Grille
          expanded to Amman, Jordan. Nestled in the vibrant streets of Amman, we quickly 
          became a beacon for those seeking the true tastes of Iraq and the broader Middle 
          East, combined with a touch of modern elegance. Our commitment to innovation and 
          authenticity resonated with locals and visitors alike.<p />
        <p>In 2012, we took another bold step, crossing oceans to open in San
        Diego, California. Here, we blended the rich flavors of our heritage
        with the diverse culinary landscape of the United States. While the
        Tigris River may be thousands of miles away, its spirit flows
        through every dish we serve, connecting our guests to the deep
        history and culture of Iraq.</p>
          <p>At Tigris Meditteranean Grille, every meal is more than just food<code>&#8212;</code>it's 
          a story. A connection to a culture as rich and deep as the river that inspires us. We invite 
          you to join us and experience the flavors, stories, and traditions that have shaped our journey.</p>
